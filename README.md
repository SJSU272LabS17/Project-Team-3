# SmartCams

# Abstract  :
Problem Statement :
Building an intelligent security system that can sample a video stream(that could be from a surveillance camera) and look for the presence of people and send alerts. 

# Proposed Solution :
Smart Cams is a software product that leverages Visual Recognition services and provides customised solutions to end users. The camera is empowered with visual recognition abilities that could identify the presence of a person and estimate their age range and gender. It can also identify objects within a frame.

# Outcomes : 
The information pertaining to people could be extremely helpful to shop/restaurant  owners looking for in-store analytics that could help them assess the demographics of the crowd over a period of time. Smart Cams can also be used for home security to alert the owner in case someone unexpectedly turns up at his or her door.
