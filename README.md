Idea#1: Potential crime detection using visual recognition in surveillance systems

  Crime rate in California has consistently been growing. In a span of 20 years between 1960 and 1980, the growth in crime rate has been an appalling 276%. 
 Despite technology growth with highly efficient surveillance systems, the recorded data from the surveillance cameras is more often used to review details of crime scenes rather than foresee and evade its very occurrence.
  We propose a solution leveraging the power of machine learning and visual pattern recognition which could be a step towards fixing this problem. 
 Since surveillance cameras in an area/shopping complex(or any defined geographic scope) are wifi connected and centrally monitored, we could sample the 
 video stream to capture snapshots which could be fed into visual recognition tools to identify potential crime scenes beforehand (by analysing the image for 
 presence of any weapons) . A notification/alarm could consequently be triggered to the concerned authorities alerting them.
