Idea#1: Intelligent Security System

Building an intelligent security system that can sample a video stream(that could be from a surveillance camera) and look for the presence of unacceptable or potentially threat-posing objects (as configured by the user) and raise an alarm alerting the concerned authorities.


Idea#2: Customer Behaviour Analysis in online shopping

Online shopping has been growing on a large scale in the recent times. As a result of this, huge amount of data pertaining to customer activity is available online. This data can be used for identifying patterns in customer shopping behaviour and online customer classification.

We propose to analyze this data to predict userâ€™s online shopping behaviour. Analyzed data is then represented in a graphical format. This graphical model helps market analysts in making decisions according to consumer's taste which in turn helps improving sales and marketing strategies. Also, this graphical model is based on statistical features and it integrates all available information to simulate decision making by implementing machine learning model. Identifying products on demand, products which are most frequently purchased are some of the ways in which data can be used.

Idea#3: Disease monitoring system

Disease monitoring system monitors and tracks the origin, spread and effects of diseases around the country. It is used to analyze, prevent and contain an outbreak of an epidemic. This system uses maps to showcase the center of epidemics, number of people affected, spread of the disease to other parts of the country. 

It uses Twitter and Facebook API to track disease feed, and display the feeds to the user. It uses table and graphs to represent analytical data: people affected by epidemic, rate at which the people were infected.
