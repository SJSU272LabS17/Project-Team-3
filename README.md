# Project-Team-3

Idea#1: Building an intelligent security system that can sample a video stream(that could be from a surveillance camera) and look for the presence of unacceptable or potentially threat-posing objects (as configured by the user) and raise an alarm alerting the concerned authorities.

How do we plan to execute?

1. For the purpose of the project, we intend on using the webcam in a laptop as our source of video stream
2. For object pattern recognition, we'll be using IBM Bluemix's Visual recognition service
3. Taking it further, we would want to capture this as time-stamped data so that the user could analyse the time slabs with maximum scope for danger.

OLD ABSTRACT FOR REFERENCE:
*************************
Potential crime detection using visual recognition in surveillance systems
Crime rate in California has consistently been growing. In a span of 20 years between 1960 and 1980, the growth in crime rate has been an appalling 276%. Despite technology growth with highly efficient surveillance systems, the recorded data from the surveillance cameras is more often used to review details of crime scenes rather than foresee and evade its very occurrence.
We propose a solution leveraging the power of machine learning and visual pattern recognition which could be a step towards fixing this problem. Since surveillance cameras in an area/shopping complex(or any defined geographic scope) are wifi connected and centrally monitored, we could sample the video stream to capture snapshots which could be fed into visual recognition tools to identify potential crime scenes beforehand (by analysing the image for presence of any weapons) . A notification/alarm could consequently be triggered to the concerned authorities alerting them.


Idea#2: Smart Farm

Problem:

The current world population of 7.3 billion is expected to reach 9.7 billion in 2050, according to the UN. The world will consequently need to produce 70% more food in 2050 than it did in 2006 in order to feed the growing population of the Earth, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN. Farmers will need to turn to new technologies to meet the growing demand for food production in the world.

Solution:

Smart Farming represents the application of modern Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) into  agriculture. Smart farms combines application of ICT solutions such as precision equipment, the Internet of Things (IoT), sensors and actuators, geo-positioning systems, Big Data, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs, drones), robotics, etc , to increase the yield of the farm , and to meet the growing demand of the world population.

The smart farm collects data about the farm (crop yield , topography , soil composition , moisture level , nitrogen level , temperature ...)  using the sensors , robots , and drones. The data is stored, processed , and presented to the farmers in the forms of maps and graphs , to help the farmers in the decision making process. The data is also used for automation of farming activities (planting seeds ,irrigation , spraying pesticides, harvesting ,feeding and monitoring livestock)  using sensors ,actuators , robots , and drones. 

Idea#3: Customer Behaviour Analysis in online shopping

Online shopping has been growing on a large scale in the recent times. As a result of this, huge amount of data pertaining to customer activity is available online. This data can be used for identifying patterns in customer shopping behaviour and online customer classification.

We propose an online ecommerce website that displays different products where the user can view and purchase products. From this system, userâ€™s online shopping behaviour is extracted and represented in a graphical format. This graphical model helps marketers in making decisions according to consumer's taste which in turn helps in improving sales and making marketing strategies. Also, this graphical model is based on statistical features and it integrates all available information to simulate decision making by implementing machine learning model. Identifying products on demand, products which are most frequently purchased are some of the ways in which data can be used.
