# SmartCams

# Abstract  :

Problem Statement :

Scenario 1:
Understanding the impact of marketing and store management on in-store sales is complicated. Not only has the shoppers behaviour changed, but the retail landscape has rapidly evolved. With the explosion of online retail stores, retail analytics helps brick and mortar stores to maintain their competitive edge by gaining meaningful insight into customer behaviour and shopping patterns.

Scenario 2:
We need to actively think about our privacy and security. As crime rates are increasing and burglaries are on becoming more sophisticated, protecting ourselves and our loved ones should be our top priority. We cannot possibly know what the future holds for us, but we can definitely put up safeguards to prevent it or at least minimize its effect.

# Proposed Solution :

Smart Cams is a software product that leverages Visual Recognition services and provides customised solutions to end users. The camera is empowered with visual recognition abilities that could identify the presence of a person. It allow users to collect, analyze and interpret the data in real time. It also collects the demographic data(gender, age, proximity) of customers. This allows the users of Smart Cams to gain meaningful insight into customer behaviour patterns, which can be used to improve store performance, pricing and promotion of products and workforce/stores streamlining. This also helps the users to improve their sales, customer experience while lower their overheads.

# Outcomes : 

Smart cams can help retailers to keep track of customer behaviour and gain a competitive edge in retail field. They help retailers to understand their customers better, targets them with better offers and deals. This enables them to increase their sales volume, profitability, and customer satisfaction. The analytical data can also be used to organize and streamline retailers work force and stores.

# Future Scope :

Smart cams can also be used for home security. Smart Cams can be configured to be activated based on motion sensors. They can be installed around the house to monitor the surroundings. Wifi enabled Smart Cams can live stream video of the surroundings, which can be accessed from remote locations. Smart cams can also be configured to recognize people's faces, and profile them. These cameras can send alerts to the users about suspicious/unfamiliar people around the house. This allows the users to keep themselves, the family members and property safe from burglars, thieves and criminals.
